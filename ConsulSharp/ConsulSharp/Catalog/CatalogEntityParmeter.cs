As with Service.ID, the CheckID must be unique on this node. Notes is an opaque field that is meant to hold human-readable text. If a ServiceID is provided that matches the ID of a service on that node, the check is treated as a service level health check, instead of a node level health check. The Status must be one of passing, warning, or critical.The Definition field can be provided with details for a TCP or HTTP health check.For more information, see the Health Checks page.Multiple checks can be provided by replacing Check with Checks and sending an array of Check objects.
